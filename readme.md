# Diabetes Dataset: EDA and Prediction  

This repository contains the project work for the **Programming and Database** course, part of the Data Science Master's degree at the University of Verona. The project focuses on the **Programming** section of the exam.  

## Academic Information  
- **Course**: Programming and Database  
- **Professor**: Niccol√≤ Marastoni  
- **Academic Year**: 2024/2025  

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to analyze and predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on health data. The dataset used for this project is `diabetes_unclean.csv`, which contains raw health data from various patients.  

### Objectives  
1. **Data Cleaning**:  
    - Handle missing or inconsistent data in `diabetes_unclean.csv`.  
    - Prepare the dataset for analysis and modeling.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
    - Explore the dataset to understand the distribution, relationships, and key patterns in the data.  

3. **Prediction**:  
    - Build a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on the features in the dataset.  

4. **Dynamic presentation**
    - Develop a dynamic presentation to showcase the results of the analysis and demonstrate the functioning of the prediction model interactively.

## Dataset  
The dataset `diabetes_unclean.csv` contains various features related to patient health. These features will be analyzed and extracted during the data cleaning and EDA phases to determine their relevance for prediction.  

## Repository Structure  
- `data/`: Contains the raw dataset (`diabetes_unclean.csv`) and any processed datasets.  
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, EDA, and modeling.  
- `src/`: Python scripts for data processing and model development.  
- `results/`: Outputs, visualizations, and model evaluation results.
